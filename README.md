## TODO

[x] darkmode fzf
[x] darkmode taskwarrior
[x] move skhdrc here and link to ~

## What is it?

- WezTerm with Catppuccin Macchiato and a few custom colors.
- Mostly standard tmux with some bindings and plugins that everyone uses.
- p10k with a few hours of customization.
- zoxcide, bat, ripgrep, fd, jq, fzf, eza, delta, and thefuck.
- Neovim/NvChad with minimap.nvim, transparent, and supermaven and also some tweaks.
- SketchyBar, borders, yabai, to make it easy on the eyes.
- aerospace, skhd, and karabiner to make it easy on the fingers.

Everything else is pretty much defaults. /maybe i'll setup nix and reveal the system preferences.

star, fork, install deps add some symlinks and source ~/.zshrc to enjoy.
